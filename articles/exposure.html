        <h1>Exposure Bracketing: A Simple Trick For Nailing The Exposure Every Time</h1>
        <p>One of the hardest things to perfect in a photo is the exposure, as there are many pieces to bring together
          for the perfect image. Exposure bracketing allows you to take 3 images at 3 different exposures which gives
          you the security of knowing that one of them will have captured the light in the best possible way.</p>
        <p>So what’s the best way to use exposure bracketing, both during the shoot and in post? Here’s how a simple
          camera setting can make sure you capture all the details in a single press of the shutter.</p>
        <p>In this guide you will learn:</p>
        <ul id="list">
          <li>What is Bracketing and Auto Exposure Bracketing (AEB)?</li>
          <li>When to use use bracketing in photography</li>
          <li>How to manage bracketing in post-processing</li>
          <li>Other types of bracketing: flash bracketing</li>
        </ul>

          <h3>What is AEB or Auto Exposure Bracketing?</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Exposure bracketing can be done manually by taking a shot, adjusting the exposure compensation or shutter
          speed and then taking another shot. Manual exposure bracketing makes it easy to customize your bracketing
          based on the scene by taking more shots for high contrast scenes and fewer shots for low contrast ones. But
          slight camera movements can make working with the different exposures difficult in post and manual bracketing
          will slow you down.</p>
        <p>Auto exposure bracketing, or AEB, tells the camera to bracket the shot for you, which means that after you
          turn the feature on, you only need to press the shutter release once to get multiple exposures of the same
          scene. AEB is included on most advanced cameras and many allow you to customize the number of bracketed shots
          and the exposure difference between each one.</p>
        <p>On the Canon Rebel series, for example, the setting is located inside the menu and referred to as AEB or
          bracketing. Canon allows users to adjust how much the exposure varies between each shot, but the Rebels only
          take three bracketed shots.</p>
        <p>The Nikon D7200 has the bracketing feature as a shortcut marked "BKT" towards the lens barrel and turning the
          front and back control dials adjusts both the exposure compensation between each shot and the number of shots,
          up to five. Nikons without the shortcut button usually have the feature inside the menu.</p>
        <p>So how much should you bracket? A 1/3 exposure compensation is the default on many cameras, creating slight
          exposure differences between shots. The 1/3 is a good setting to use if you are fairly confident about your
          exposure and for most scenes.</p>
        <p>If the scene has a high level of contrast, or you’re just really not sure that your exposure settings are
          even in the right ballpark, adding to the number of bracketed shots or setting a higher exposure compensation
          value increases the exposure range the camera captures for a wider range to choose from later.</p>
        <p>AEB is a simple way to bracket — the trickiest part is just finding out where the setting is located on your
          particular camera model. And for that, there’s exploration, the camera manual, Camera Fast Start classes, or
          of course, Google.</p>
      <div class="cl-subtitle-wrap-text">
        <h3>Should you use Photo Bracketing all the time?</h3>
      </div>
      <p>Exposure bracketing is a helpful technique for getting that exposure dead-on. Using AEB is a quick, efficient
        way of taking advantage of the method. But, while those shots are one right after another, the slight delay may
        not be for every shooting scenario. If you’re shooting sports using burst mode, you’ll have three different
        exposure values mixed into that burst, which could mean that the shot with the right timing has the wrong
        exposure.</p>
      <p>Using AEB also means you’ll be shooting three times the number of photos in about the same amount of time. That
        means your SD card will fill up three times faster and, if you don’t go through and delete the exposures you
        don’t need, your hard drive will fill up quickly as well. </p>
      <p>When detail is paramount and the exposure is tricky, AEB helps ensure you leave the shoot with the shots you
        need. While great for a number of applications such as landscape photography and street photography, the delay
        isn’t ideal for action — and the added images can be a data storage headache.</p>
    <div class="cl-subtitle-wrap-text">
      <h3>What’s the best way to manage exposure bracketing in post?</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Shooting three images instead of one also opens up more possibilities in post processing: simply choosing the
      best of the three, dodging and burning the AEB layers or the popular high dynamic range or HDR technique.</p>
    <p>Often, the best shot out of the three can be chosen with a quick glance — but not always. Using a RAW editor,
      sometimes the shadows are easier to recover than the highlights and vice versa, which means you may want to pick
      the brighter or darker image not because it’s closer to what you want, but because more of the details are
      recoverable. A good rule of thumb is to start with the closest image, but don’t trash the other exposures until
      you are finished with your edit.</p>
    <p>But what if you like the shadows in one shot, but perhaps the sky in another? Using Photoshop or another image
      editor, you can layer all three bracketed exposures into a single file, with the best exposure on the top. Using
      the eraser with different brush sizes or selection tools, you can brush away select areas to reveal the photos
      underneath. This is similar to using the dodging and burning tools, only you have more data to work with because
      of those multiple exposures.</p>
    <p>HDR is similar to that layered dodge and burn, only all of the images are typically merged together instead of
      selecting which part of which shot you would like to show. With the images merged, the final file has a greater
      range of light than what’s possible to capture in a single shot. HDR is a post processing technique, while
      bracketing is the shooting technique that makes it possible. (You can read more about how to process a set of
      bracketed exposures for HDR here). While HDR is an incredible technique for high contrast scenes, it’s also easy
      to overdo. With AEB, however, you have the data to choose whether dodging and burning or a full HDR merge will get
      you closest to the look you are going for.</p>
    <div class="cl-subtitle-wrap-text">
      <h3>Is exposure the only thing that can be bracketed?</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Actually, no. Exposure is the most popular type of bracketing and a feature that’s included on most advanced
      cameras. Bracketing a flash to adjust the intensity of the light with each shot can be just as helpful, or even
      more so, since manual flash involves a bit more guesswork than choosing exposure settings based on the light
      meter. Too much flash often means odd shadows, but too little doesn’t grab enough of the details. Auto flash
      bracketing is a viable solution if you’re not confident in your settings or if you need to move along quickly
      without checking the shot.</p>
    <p>Setting flash exposure bracketing (FEB) is very similar to AEB, except the setting may be located in a different
      spot. For Nikon shooters, for example, FEB is inside the custom menu under Exposure/Flash, including the option to
      switch from just bracketing the ambient light, or bracketing with the flash. Some hot shoe flashes also have their
      own FEB options, including Canon Speedlites. Both will allow you to adjust the difference between the shot in
      stops, just like with exposure bracketing.</p>
    <p>Some cameras will also adjust settings outside of exposure and flash in a bracketed series, though these settings
      are often less useful than exposure and flash bracketing. Nikon, for example, allows for white balance bracketing.
      Since shooting in RAW allows you to adjust the white balance later anyways, this setting is less helpful.</p>
    <p>If the third time’s a charm, bracketing helps guarantee a charming shot by automatically taking shots with three
      different settings. Exposure bracketing helps photographers grab the ideal exposure while out shooting — but it
      also makes post processing techniques possible using more data from multiple images. While auto exposure
      bracketing is the most popular, flash bracketing can help flash newbies perfect the art of blending a flash with
      the ambient light.</p>
