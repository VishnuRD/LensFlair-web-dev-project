        <h1>Learning to use ISO correctly</h1>
        <p>ISO is one of the three pillars of photography (the other two being shutter speed and aperture), and it has a
          major effect on your images. How does camera ISO affect your images? In this article, we will introduce ISO
          for beginners and explain how to use it effectively for the best possible results.</p>
        <div class="cl-subtitle-wrap-text">
          <h3>What is ISO?</h3>
        </div>
        <p>In very basic terms, ISO is simply a camera setting that will brighten or darken a photo. As you increase
          your ISO number, your photos will grow progressively brighter. For that reason, ISO can help you capture
          images in darker environments, or be more flexible about your aperture and shutter speed settings.
          However, raising your ISO has consequences. A photo taken at too high of an ISO will show a lot of grain, also
          known as noise, and might not be usable. So, brightening a photo via ISO is always a trade-off. You should
          only raise your ISO when you are unable to brighten the photo via shutter speed or aperture instead (for
          example, if using a longer shutter speed would cause your subject to be blurry).</p>
        <div class="cl-subtitle-wrap-text">
          <h3>Common ISO Values</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Every camera has a different range of ISO values (sometimes called ISO speeds) that you can use. A common set
          is as follows:
        <ul id="list">
          <li>ISO 100 (low ISO)</li>
          <li>ISO 200</li>
          <li>ISO 400</li>
          <li>ISO 800</li>
          <li>ISO 1600</li>
          <li>ISO 3200</li>
          <li>ISO 6400 (high ISO)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Quite simply, when you double your ISO speed, you are doubling the brightness of the photo. So, a photo at
          ISO 400 will be twice brighter than ISO 200, which will be twice brighter than ISO 100.</p>
        <div class="cl-subtitle-wrap-text">
          <h3>How to Change ISO</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Changing ISO varies from camera to camera. Here are some common ways to change ISO:
        <ul id="list">
          <li>To start, enter a mode that lets you select the ISO yourself. Get out of Auto mode, and go to Manual,Shutter Priority, Aperture Priority, or Program (we tend to prefer Aperture Priority or Manual).</li>
          <li>For entry-level DSLRs and mirrorless cameras, you probably need to open a menu (possibly the “quick menu”) and find the section for ISO. Select the value you want, or set it to Auto.</li>
          <li>For higher-end cameras, there may be a dedicated “ISO” button on the camera. Press it while spinning one of the wheels to change your ISO setting. If you don’t see a button labeled “ISO”, it is still possible that your camera will let you program one to perform this task.</li>
          <li>Other cameras may have a dedicated wheel that already has various ISO settings marked. This makes things even easier.</li>
        </ul></p>
           <p>Check your camera manual if you still aren’t sure. However, it is worth being very familiar with how to
           change your ISO setting quickly, since it’s something you will likely be adjusting quite often, especially
           if you shoot in low light conditions without a tripod or flash.</p>
        <div class="cl-subtitle-wrap-text">
          <h3>When to Use Low ISO</h3>
        </div>
          <p>You should always try to stick to the lowest ISO (base ISO) of your camera, which is typically ISO 100 or
            200, whenever you can. If there is plenty of light, you are free to use a low ISO and minimize the
            appearance of noise as much as possible.</p>
          <p>Even in dim or dark environments, you still might be able to use a low ISO. For example, if you have your
            camera mounted on a tripod or sitting completely still on a table. In that case, you can safely use a low
            ISO and brighten your photo via a long shutter speed instead, since you won’t introduce camera shake. </p>
        <div class="cl-subtitle-wrap-text">
            <h3>When to Use High ISO</h3>
        </div>
          <p>Even though it is ideal to use low ISOs, there will be plenty of times when a high ISO is necessary in
            order to take a good photo in the first place. The simple reason is that you are often fighting against
            motion blur, and you will need to pick between a sharp photo at a high ISO, or a blurry photo at a low ISO.
          </p>
          <p>The bottom line is that you should increase the ISO when there is not enough light for the camera to
            capture a sharp, bright photo any other way.On most cameras, there is a setting for Auto ISO, which works
            great in low-light environments. The beauty of this setting is that you input the maximum ISO you are
            willing to use, so that the camera does not cross that limit.</p>
        <div class="cl-subtitle-wrap-text">
            <h3>Minimizing Noise and Maximizing Image Quality</h3>
        </div>
          <p>Some photographers think that the best way to capture high-quality images is to use Base ISO 100% of the
            time. However,that simply is not true. Sometimes, you’ll be in dark environments when you have no choice but
            to use a higher ISO.</p>
          <p>You should only use base ISO when there is enough light to do so. Don’t try to force ISO 100 in a dark
            environment, or your photos will come out way too dark. Similarly, if you’re using a fast shutter speed to
            capture action, it’s essentially the same as taking pictures in a dark environment (since you strictly limit
            the amount of time your camera sensor is able to capture light). So, for certain types of sports and action
            photography, a high ISO might be your only option.</p>
          <p>To maximize your image quality, here are the four steps you need to follow:
          <ul id="list">
            <li>Select the aperture setting that will provide your desired depth of field.</li>
            <li>Set your ISO to its base value, and put your shutter speed to whatever setting provides a proper
              exposure.</li>
            <li>If your subject is blurry, progressively raise your ISO and use a faster shutter speed until motion blur
              disappears.</li>
            <li>If your ISO is getting too high and you still have the ability to use a wider aperture, open it up until
              the
              ISO gets to a more manageable level, even if it means sacrificing some of your desired depth of field.
            </li>
          </ul></p>
          <p>That’s all it takes! If you follow these steps, you’ll capture the maximum image quality each time. You’ll
          find the ideal balance between noise, motion blur, and depth of field.</p>
