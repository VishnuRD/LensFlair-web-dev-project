        <h1>The Beginner’s Guide to Long Exposure Photography</h1>

        <p>Photography captures a moment in time — but who says that moment has to be a split second? Long exposure
          photography takes a single image over several seconds or even several minutes. Because long exposure
          photography blurs everything that moves, it’s a popular medium for shooting subjects with consistent movement,
          like a waterfall or crowd of people. The longer exposure time also makes it a helpful tool for shooting in low
          light.</p>
        <p>But as helpful (and incredible) as long exposure photography can be, it’s also a tricky technique to master
          at first. Here’s what beginners need to know about long exposure photography.</p>

        <div class="cl-subtitle-wrap-text">
          <h3>What is Long Exposure Photography</h3>
        </div>

        <p>Long exposure photography is when you use a longer shutter speed and is usually used to create a specific
          effect in an image.</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>The camera’s shutter opens to expose the sensor (or a strip of film) to light. Most photographs are taken in
          fractions of a second, with the shutter quickly opening and closing to freeze the moment. Any motion that
          occurs while the shutter is open creates blur. While new photographers are often frustrated to see blur in
          their images without knowing why, long exposure intentionally manipulates the shutter speed to create artistic
          blur, turning the flow of a river milky smooth or creating circular streaks from the stars moving across the
          sky.</p>
        <p>Shutter speed is also one of three different settings that affects an image’s exposure, or how light or dark
          the image is. A digital camera sensor is essentially a solar panel. If you cover that solar panel with a giant
          blanket, of course, it’s not going to get any light. But, the longer you leave that solar panel uncovered, the
          more light rays it will be able to absorb and turn into energy. Shutter speed is the same idea, only instead
          of gathering light to turn into energy, that “solar panel” is converting light into a digital image.</p>
        <p>Using a long exposure is a tool photographers use for many different reasons. First, long exposures create an
          almost dream-like look because of that motion blur. Clouds become misty streaks, waves create a dance of
          smooth patterns, and night traffic becomes streaks of lights, making the medium popular for landscape
          photography. People can even become a long exposure subject — moving crowds become smooth streaks while any
          individuals standing still or moving slowly appear sharper.</p>
        <p>Since a longer shutter speed lets in more light, long exposures are sometimes used as a tool to conquer
          limited light. If a scene does not have any movement — like in food or product photography — using a long
          exposure allows for low ISOs even if the light is minimal.</p>

        <div class="cl-subtitle-wrap-text">
          <h3>the Trouble with Long Exposure Photography - and what you need to fix it</h3>
        </div>

        <p>Long exposure photography, however, introduces a number of different challenges — but most of these are met
          with with the help of an accessory.</p>
        <p>Since everything that moves during a long exposure blurs, these photographs cannot be shot handheld. Small
          movements in your hands will move the camera and the entire image will be a blur. Tripods are a necessity for
          long exposures — you don’t need a $500 outfit, but finding one that’s not going to drop your camera in the
          dirt or give you an incredible backache on your hike is a good idea.</p>
        <p>If you are shooting at night or close to it, you can shoot a long exposure with just a tripod and a camera.
          But, if you want to shoot during the day, you’ll need a neutral density filter. Remember, the longer you leave
          the shutter open, the more light that’s let inside the photograph. Even if you compensate with a narrow
          aperture and a low ISO during the day, there’s still too much light to get a long shutter speed without
          overexposing the scene into a big white blur.</p>
        <p>Neutral density filters (NDs) intentionally block out light so you can shoot that long exposure while there’s
          still clouds in the sky to blur or while there’s still enough light to safely hike out to that waterfall. NDs
          are essentially a pair of sunglasses for your lens.</p>
        <p>NDs are rated for just how much light they block out. If you’re shooting at sunset and only need a few
          seconds, a lighter filter will do. If you’re shooting closer to mid-day, or really want a long exposure time,
          you’ll need a darker filter. A .6 ND filter will get you four times the light reduction, good for “short” long
          exposures for fast subjects, like waterfalls. For shooting during the day, a 3.0 ND (with about 1,000x light
          reduction) or higher is best. ND filters are often sold in sets so it’s easy to experiment (and long exposure
          photography often takes lots of experimenting). Variable neutral density filters, circular filters that
          increase in intensity when you turn them, are another option.</p>

        <div class="cl-subtitle-wrap-text">
          <h3>How to shoot a long exposure</h3>
        </div>

        <p>Shooting a good long exposure starts with analyzing the scene. Identify anything that’s moving and try to
          picture how that motion would look blurred. Look for less obvious movement too — the wind through the trees,
          for example, can blur a long exposure. Take note of how that object is moving and how fast. The best long
          exposure shots tend to have something moving, while still having something completely still to anchor the
          scene.</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>Once you have your composition in your mind, set up a tripod with your camera to keep the frame still.
          Switching to the two second timer mode, or using a remote release if you have one, helps prevent any bumps to
          the tripod, which can manifest as a soft or slightly blurred image. If your camera has a mirror lock up,
          located in the menu or sometimes designated on a shortcut as “MUP,” turn it on to prevent additional blur.</p>
        <p>Turn the mode dial to shutter priority mode, or, if you’re comfortable in manual mode, go ahead and take
          control of the entire exposure. Set your shutter speed based on how fast the motion is in the image — this
          will likely take some experimenting, so don’t be afraid to guess, take a shot, then reshoot. A few seconds is
          often good for fast subjects like waterfalls and traffic. For slower movement, like clouds, 20 to 30 seconds
          may be necessary to get an obvious blur.</p>
        <p>Long exposures aren’t limited to just seconds either —some images are taken over several minutes, such as
          star trail photography. Most cameras stop at a 30 second shutter speed, however, so to go longer than that
          half minute, turn the shutter dial until you reach Bulb mode. Bulb mode will leave the shutter open until you
          press the shutter release again. You’ll need that remote here, since stopping the exposure with that second
          press tends to introduce camera shake even on a tripod. (Keeping an eye on a stopwatch can also be handy in
          Bulb mode).</p>
        <p>Use the lowest ISO setting available on your camera, and use the RAW or RAW + JPEG setting for more
          flexibility in post processing later.</p>
        <p>With your best guesstimate of how long your shutter speed should be based on the movement in the image, take
          a look at the light meter and see how far off your exposure is. (If you’re not familiar with shooting in
          manual modes, the light meter is the little scale on the bottom or side of the viewfinder — aim for the middle
          of the graph for a proper exposure. In shutter priority mode on many camera models, the shutter speed will
          also blink if the meter says the image is overexposed.</p>
        <p>If you are significantly overexposed, add your neutral density filter. If you’re still overexposed, you’ll
          need a thicker neutral density filter (or, with many square filters, you can use two at a time) or you’ll need
          to turn the shutter speed down a bit. In manual mode, you can also adjust your aperture to correct some
          overexposure.</p>
        <p>Once you’re adjusted for a proper exposure (which, depending on the look you are going for may not be dead
          center in the light meter), take the first shot, being careful not to touch the tripod while the image is
          being recorded.</p>
        <p>Then, take a critical look at the photo before you pack up and move to the next shot
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Is there enough blur? If not, then turn the shutter speed down.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Is the image too bright? Then add a (or a stronger) neutral density filter, use a lower ISO or a narrower
              aperture. If the image is still too bright with your strongest ND filter, narrowest aperture and lowest
              ISO, you may need to re-plan the shoot to come back at dusk.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Is the entire image blurred or a bit soft? Try the shot again with the timer and make sure not to touch
              the tripod while the image is recording. If you’re still getting an issue, make sure the wind isn’t moving
              your tripod a bit and that the mirror lock up is turned on.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Long exposures often take a bit of experimentation to find the shutter speed that works perfectly with the
          speed of the motion in your pictures, so don’t get frustrated if it takes you a few shots to get it just right
          — that’s completely normal. The more often you shoot long exposures, the more accurate your first shutter
          speed estimate will be as you get an idea for what physical speeds work best with which shutter speeds.</p>
        <p>Long exposures require a bit more prep work and a bit more effort in getting that single shot — but often
          create stunning images that certainly stand out in a world of smartphone snapshots. Learning long exposures
          can help build your confidence and your troubleshooting skills — and that comes in handy no matter what you
          shoot.</p>

        <div class="cl-subtitle-wrap-text">
          <h3>Sharpen Image Tools</h3>
        </div>

        <p>Focus is one thing that no amount of post-processing can fix (unless of course you have an adjustable focus
          light field camera). But, there are a few tools for making a sharp photo sharper. When you shoot in RAW,
          unlike with a JPEG, there’s no sharpening applied to the image, which means it’s important to add your own
          sharpening.</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>In Lightroom®, sharpening options are all under the detail slider. The amount controls how much of the
          sharpening effect to apply — and a nice red section of the slider serves as a nice reminder that over
          sharpening is easy to do. The radius determines if the sharpening happens on the edge of the pixel or at the
          middle — a larger radius generally creates a more defined edge. The detail option fine-tunes, focusing more on
          the finer details of the image instead of the whole image. Masking allows you to control what areas of the
          image the effect is applied to — moving the slider to the right means the sharpening will be applied to fewer
          areas.</p>
        <p>Sharpening an image in Photoshop® is a bit more complex. The Filter > Sharpen menu contains several different
          options. The unsharp mask and smart sharpen are popular options, both with amount and radius sliders. much
          like in Lightroom.</p>


        <div class="cl-subtitle-wrap-text">
          <h3>The Healing Brush and Clone Stamps</h3>
        </div>

        <p>One of the biggest perks to post processing is removing objects that you don’t really want in the scene.
          While it’s almost always easier to move that object before you shoot, you can’t exactly move a telephone pole
          out of your landscape or make zits disappear from your portrait subject.</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>The clone brush takes a portion of the image and makes an exact replica. An option or control click allows
          you to select the area that you want to replicate and choosing the brush size allows you to fine tune where
          the effect is applied. Clicking and painting over the area makes an exact clone of the original area. In
          Photoshop®, you can also open two different images and set the reference point in one and then apply the clone
          in a completely different image.</p>
        <p>The healing brush is like a smarter clone stamp. The software recognizes other colors and patterns in the
          area, and removes objects based on that data. The healing brush often creates more seamless adjustments, but
          offers less control than the clone stamp.</p>
        <p>Most photographers do specific adjustments like this in Photoshop®. Both the clone stamp and healing brush
          are in the toolbox. Here, the healing brush has two variations — the regular healing brush where you set a
          reference point, and the spot healing brush where there’s no reference point and the computer adjusts based on
          the surrounding pixels. The healing brush is best for removing small objects surrounded by similar pixels,
          like removing zits, while the clone tool is good for more complex work.</p>
        <p>Lightroom® doesn’t offer as much control, but the spot removal tool works in a similar way, with both clone
          and heal options, and is good for simpler fixes.</p>


        <div class="cl-subtitle-wrap-text">
          <h3>Dodge and Burn</h3>
        </div>

        <p>Dodge and burn is a leftover from film processing techniques, but still a useful one. Like the clone and heal
          tools, the dodge and burn is a brush, so you can paint over the image where you want to apply the effect.</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>Dodge lightens specific areas of an image, while burn darkens. Both are Photoshop® tools inside the toolbar,
          while a top menu allows users to adjust the range and exposure — or how light or dark the effect is — as well
          as brush size and if that brush has a solid or faded edge.</p>


        <div class="cl-subtitle-wrap-text">
          <h3>Adjustment Layers and Adjustment Brushes</h3>
        </div>

        <p>So far, we’ve discussed photography post processing techniques that are either applied to the entire image, a
          color or tonal range, or painted on using brush tools. Adjustment layers (Photoshop®) and brushes (Lightroom®)
          take all of those adjustments that can be applied to the entire image and apply the same effect to only a
          portion of the image.</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>Adjustment layers in Photoshop® apply effects to a layer, not the actual image. They’re added by going up to
          Layer > New Adjustment Layer and selecting one of the many options from exposure to vibrance. Each layer has
          further options — the hue saturation layer allows you to choose a color channel, for example, so you can
          create a red hue layer and adjust only the reds just like using the red slider in Lightroom®. Adjustment
          layers are important because it turns Photoshop into a non-destructive photo editor. That means you can create
          a hue and saturation layer and adjust it, go through other edits and go back and fine tune that hue adjustment
          without hitting the undo button and losing all that work.</p>
        <p>Layer masks allow those effects to be applied to only a specific part of the photograph. At the bottom of the
          layers panel, clicking the white square with a black circle adds a layer mask — you’ll see a white box pop up
          in that layer. If you take a paintbrush while that white layer mask box is selected and select black, the
          effects inside that layer will only be applied to the area you paint in. For example, say you create a red hue
          layer and you want to reduce the redness in the subject’s face but leave their cherry red lipstick — simply
          use a layer mask and paint only their face and not the lips.</p>
        <p>While Lightroom® has fewer tools for more specific edits, an adjustment brush offers a similar concept. After
          selecting the adjustment brush, you can use different sliders to choose what you want to adjust, then paint
          the effect on only certain portions of the image. For example, I frequently use an adjustment brush with the
          saturation brought down to whiten teeth without opening up Photoshop®.</p>


        <div class="cl-subtitle-wrap-text">
          <h3>Frequency Separation</h3>
        </div>

        <p>Many different post processing techniques stem from the use of Layers in Photoshop® — and frequency
          separation is a widely used option. Frequency separation follows a complex process for separating the image’s
          colors and the photo’s textures into separate layers, allowing you to adjust them individually. That means you
          can correct wrinkles without affecting the skin tone.</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>Once the layers are separated, you can use brushes to add or eliminate texture, or adjust colors. Frequency
          separation is a complex process, but once you learn how to separate the colors and textures (or create a
          Photoshop® action for it), it can be a very helpful tool.</p>


        <div class="cl-subtitle-wrap-text">
          <h3>Gradients</h3>
        </div>

        <p>Sometimes, you want an effect to be applied over a large portion of the image, fading out until the rest of
          the photograph is untouched. That’s made possible through gradients. Gradients are often helpful for touching
          up a boring or overexposed sky, but there are many different applications for them.</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>In Lightroom, two tools are used for exactly that. The graduated filter applies effects linearly and fades
          out, while the radial tool applies the effects circularly, making it possible to affect only the center or
          only the edges, instead of just a linear portion. With either of these tools selected, sliders allow you to
          adjust anything from exposure to saturation.</p>
        <p>Inside Photoshop®, gradients can be applied to a layer mask instead of painting in certain areas to create a
          similar effect. With the gradient tool selected, a dropdown menu at the top allows you to select the of the
          gradient and the colors. For applying gradients to layer masks, use a black and white gradient.</p>
